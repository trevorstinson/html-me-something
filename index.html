        <p id="lead">The Alliance to Restore the Republic<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">1</a></sup> could not have been successful without their robust starfighter corps. Although the Imperial Starfleet easily outclassed the Rebellion's forces in numbers, reach, and firepower, the Alliance was able to leverage these ships that were emblematic of their own ethos: nimble, versatile, and easily underestimated.</p>

                <h2>Y-wing</h2>
                <p>The oldest of the starfighters commonly seen among the Alliance fleet, the Y-wing was designed and built during the Clone Wars. The ships still in service have seen their share of combat and are kept spaceworthy by resourceful mechanics.</p>
                <p>Technically classified as a bomber, the Y-wing is slow compared to newer fighters, but packs a lot of firepower. Its low maneuverability is partially compensated for by a top-mounted turret which seats a dedicated gunner.</p>

                <h2>X-wing</h2>
                <p>The Incom T-65 is the most iconic of the Rebel starfighters. It earned this reputation by being the ship that took down both Death Stars. The X-wing was brought to the Alliance shortly before the Battle of Yavin by the timely defection of the majority of the Incom Corporation.</p>
                <p>The X-wing was designed to be a space superiority fighter, with all major characteristics perfectly balanced.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="ref-2">2</a></sup> Its weapons spread and maneuverability make it formidable in a dogfight, while it is also capable of carrying weapons such as proton torpedoes which are more characteristic of a bomber. This combination is what enabled it to both fight through the Death Star's fighter cover and deliver the critical blow that took out the planetkiller.</p>

                <h2>A-wing</h2>
                <p>The A-wing is arguable the fastest and most maneuverable starfighter in use during the Galactic Civil War. Although not the toughest starfighter, its speed and agility helped it to counter the expanding versatility of the Imperial Navy's TIE fighter line. The A-wing was capable of quick hit-and-run strikes in a war where all-out confrontation was not always an option.</p>
                <p>Although not generally equipped to take on capital ships, A-wings turned the tide of the battle of Endor when Green Squadron took out <em>Executor</em>'s shield generators. When <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Arvel_Crynyd">Arvel Crynyd</a> (Green Leader) was shot down shortly thereafter, he managed to guide his A-wing into the unshielded bridge of the Super Star Destroyer, causing it to be pulled into the <em>Death Star II</em>'s gravity well.</p>

                <h2>B-wing</h2>
                <p>Although large and slow for a starfighter, and far too small and lightly armored to be considered a member of any other class, the B-wing is a formidable bomber. It is designed to take on ships much larger than itself, and depends on cover from more agile starfighters. The gyroscopic cockpit provides some flexibility not usually seen in a bomber this heavy, but it also requires a skilled pilot.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>U-wing</h2>
                <p>The U-wing is primarily a troop transport and did not factor heavily into ship-to-ship combat. It saw limited production before its maker, Incom, was nationalized by the Galactic Empire. Most of the staff were able to defect to the Rebellion, taking the plans for the upcoming X-wing along with them, but the U-wing's production run was ended prematurely and it was never seen in large numbers.</p>
                <p>The U-wing was an important player in the Battle of Scarif. When news of Rogue One's unauthorized attack reached Yavin 4, U-wings were among the ships the came to their aid. Many of them were able to break through the planet's shield gate to land troops. This sacrifice brought the already small number of U-wings to almost zero. </p>
